    abstract:
        Insurance companies today are incurring a loss in billions of
        dollars every year because of frauds happening in filing
        claims, paying premiums, filling applications etc. Detecting
        frauds manually or by other traditional means is an impossible
        task since magnanimous amounts of data is getting generated
        every day and fraudsters change their strategies very
        quickly. For handling such a humongous amount of data,
        performing real time analysis on it, and getting accurate
        outputs; it is imperative that a robust, flexible and scalable
        technology be used which can detect frauds on the fly. Big
        data provides just the platform needed to perform analysis of
        such high complexity.
