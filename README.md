# White-paper-Big-Data-Applications-in-Insurance-Fraud-Detection

Insurance companies today are incurring a loss in billions of dollars
every year because of frauds happening in filing claims, paying
premiums, filling applications etc. Detecting frauds manually or
by other traditional means is an impossible task since magnanimous
amounts of data is getting generated every day and fraudsters
change their strategies very quickly. For handling such a humongous
amount of data, performing real time analysis on it, and getting
accurate outputs; it is imperative that a robust, flexible and scalable
technology be used which can detect frauds on the fly. Big data
provides just the platform needed to perform analysis of such high
complexity.
